A Python rendering of the "Jump All But One"
game found on tables at Cracker Barrel.

To jump, one must enter the position numbers
of the peg and jump to location. The position
numbers are laid out as follows:
            0
           1 2
          3 4 5
         6 7 8 9
      10 11 12 13 14
etc.

The game ends once 'q' is entered.

When the board is printed, all locations with
'x' have a peg, 'o' are empty. The visual idea
was the bird's-eye view.
